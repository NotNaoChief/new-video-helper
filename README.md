# new-video-helper
I used to edit a lot of videos for fun. I had a system of always naming
the video folder the current date, and starting with with a sub 
directory of raw for the raw footage to go. When I completed that 
project, I'd always move it to the same archive. I wrote this script to
expedite that process.
 
Using the command line and minimal input:
- Create a new directory named the current date, with a sub-directory
of Raw and add the new directory to a log
- Using the log move this directory to the archives.
